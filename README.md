This is a collection of notes and practice problems from Code School. 

**It is important to note that there are no videos, pictures, slide shows, or power points from Code School.**

It is only a collection of what I learned.

### Notes

*1. &nbsp;&nbsp;A question can involve a question with shell command answer, a question with an explanation as an answer, a multiple choice question with 1 or more answers, a question where you need to fill in a blank, or changing existing code to work.*

*2. &nbsp;&nbsp;A challenge is code that can be compiled and run. Whether it be HTML/CSS in a web browser, Python, JavaScript through Node, etc. A challenge can also be a coded solution to a problem.*

*3. &nbsp;&nbsp; An Optional Project is a project that can be completed by following the course's Questions/Challenges in a specified order. While not necessary, it is a good way to implement understand of course material.*
