## **Note**

The challenges and questions in this course can be mixed together to create a working web application. A file will be included, [Project Order](./projectOrder.md), with an order in which to complete the questions/challenges. Also included will be a completed version of the project you can make, [FoodTracker](./FoodTracker/).

If you do not wish to create the project, you do not have to follow a specific order in the questions/challenges. It is recommended however that you follow along to be able to test your challenge solutions.
